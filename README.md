# Artificial Neural Network Project

This project is a simple implementation of an artificial neural network using Python, Jupyter Notebook, Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. It was developed by Rithik Appachi Senthilkumar and teammates Kaushik Karthikeyan, Lenka Hake, and Olaf Heijl. The project aims to showcase the basic concepts and functionality of artificial neural networks.

## Overview

The Artificial Neural Network Project is a demonstration of a basic neural network model built using Python and various data science libraries. It serves as a starting point for understanding the fundamental concepts of neural networks, including feedforward and backpropagation algorithms.

The project leverages the following libraries:

- Numpy: For efficient numerical computations and handling of multi-dimensional arrays.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, including reading and preprocessing datasets.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization, enabling graphical representation of the neural network's performance.

Prior to developing the Artificial Neural Network, a simple perceptron is developed and trained. 

The Artificial Neural Network is designed for a multi-class classification task and uses the following activation functions:
- Hidden layers: Sigmoid function
- Output layer: Softmax function

The loss function used is Categorical cross-entropy.

The performance of the network is determined by a multitude of evaluation metrics:
- Regularized loss function (categorical cross-entropy).
- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy score

## Installation

To run this project locally, you need to have Python 3.10 and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

2. Install the required Python packages by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the project folder and open the `Main.ipynb` file.

## Usage

The `Main.ipynb` notebook provides a step-by-step guide to understanding and implementing the artificial neural network. Each code cell is accompanied by detailed explanations, making it easy to follow along and experiment with different parameters.

To run the notebook, click on the "Run" button for each code cell or use the keyboard shortcut `Shift + Enter`. Feel free to modify the code and explore various aspects of the neural network.

## Dataset

The datasets included within this project are in the `data` folder and consist of the following files:
- `features.txt` containing the features for the known data.
- `targets.txt` containing the class labels for the known data.
- `unknown.txt` containing the features for the unknown data.

After determining the classes for the unknown data using the ANN, the predictions are located in the `predictions.txt` file.
